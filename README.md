# What is PaOn?
PaOn is a system that allows users to experience a realistic park indoors through an open source skeletal estimation model.
Real-time multiplayer is implemented using only C# with Unity and MagicOnion.
(The name is from ParkOnline...)

PaOn mainly targets children who are covid-19 and cannot play outside.


It was created by five students from Fukui National College of Technology in Japan for the 33rd National College of Technology Programming Contest (2022).
